        <h3>Level Set Method for Modeling Cell Polarity in Pavement Cells</h3>
        <p class="author">Alysha Toomey</p>
        <p class="abstract">Mechanisms that generate the polarity of individual cells and mechanisms that coordinate tissue polarity over neighboring cells are often regarded as separate processes, and their interdependencies are poorly understood. One model system used to study this relationship is the jigsaw-puzzle-like pavement cells in Arabidopsis leaves. In this talk, I will be discussing the preliminary modeling approach we are using to unravel how an initially spatially uniform signal can induce the correct polarization to produce the signature puzzle-piece shaped cells.</p>

        <p class="author">Michael McNulty</p>
        <p class="abstract"> We will discuss the number e and some of its wonderful properties. Viewed in the right way, these properties serve as links between many concepts in differential equations, linear algebra, and complex analysis. These links turn the study of differential equations from a nearly impossible task into a reasonably tractable one. This will be explored through several examples.</p>

        <h3>Agent Based Modeling of Neural Stem Cell Migration</h3>
        <p class="author">Austin Hansen</p>
        <p class="abstract"> Neural Stem Cells (NSC’s) hold the remarkable ability to respond to chemotactic signals, pass through the blood brain barrier, and localize around tumors as well as other injury sites. This provides an exciting treatment option due to their ability to repair damage in the brain as well as deliver therapeutics directly to the site. However, the efficacy of these therapies are contingent upon enough viable cells reaching the desired locations. Since experiments for such treatments are often expensive; computational models of NCS migration are needed to optimize dosing/injection strategies. We extend the model established in Gomez et al. (2022) and fit this to experimental data in the settings of Glioblastoma and Traumatic Brain Injury. In the case of TBI the proposed model proves to be inadequate to explain the experimental data. Thus we look to further extend the model to include a repair mechanism as well as the effects of cytokine distributions on the proliferation and survival of NSCs.</p>

        <h3>Modeling of glioma tumors in CAR T-cell treatment</h3>
        <p class="author">Tony Li</p>
        <p class="abstract">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell based immunotherapy has shown its potential in treating blood cancers, and its application to solid tumors is currently being extensively investigated. For glioma brain tumors, various CAR T-cell targets include IL13Rα2, EGFRvIII, HER2, EphA2, GD2, B7-H3, and chlorotoxin. In our work, we are interested in developing a mathematical model of IL13Rα2 targeting CAR T-cells for treating glioma. We focus on extending the work of Kuznetsov et al. (1994) by considering the binding of multiple CAR T-cells to a single glioma cell, and the dynamics of these multi-cellular conjugates. Our model more accurately describes experimentally observed CAR T-cell killing assay data than a model which does not consider cell binding. Moreover, we derive conditions in the CAR T-cell expansion rate that determines treatment success or failure. Finally, we show that our model captures distinct CAR T-cell killing dynamics at low, medium, and high antigen receptor densities in patient-derived brain tumor cells.</p>

        <h3>Heegaard Splittings and Dehn Surgery</h3>
        <p class="author">Raymond Matson</p>
        <p class="abstract"> Our eventual goal is to sketch a proof showing how to construct any closed orientable 3-manifold out of performing Dehn surgery on S^3. Dehn surgery is a way of decomposing, modifying, and gluing back together some 3-manifold in order to construct a different 3-manifold. In order to motivate this and understand the proper decomposition, we will first discuss Heegaard splittings. These topological constructions are closely related to knot theory, homology, and mapping class groups. There's some fun to be had decomposing these manifolds into multiple pieces and gluing them back together in interesting ways. </p>

        <h3>In Search for Invariant Polynomials</h3>
        <p class="author">Neima Ghandian</p>
        <p class="abstract"> In this talk we will try to find and classify all invariant polynomials under a specific algebraic map. This is a classic problem seen at the start of algebraic geometry, which can be translated combinatorially into a much easier to approach problem. We will introduce some notions from algebra, graph theory, and geometry to help us on our endeavor. Our discussion will be constrained to mostly 2-dimensional graphs, as the majority of this problem is still open research.  </p>

        <h3>An energy conserving Local discontinuous Galerkin Method for solving power-law beam equations</h3>
        <p class="author">Isaac Tate</p>
        <p class="abstract"> The Euler-Bernoulli Beam equation for power-law materials describes the mechanics of a material of which its stress-strain curve exhibits a power-law relationship. While this equation is commonly introduced to undergraduate engineers, its analytic general solution is an open problem. Restricting studies numerically still ends up being difficult. In this talk I will introduce the local discontinuous galerkin (LDG) method, and work done to approach this equation as well as possible future work to improve behavior. </p>

        <h3>Solving An Easy Analysis Problem: Together</h3>
        <p class="author">Chris Grossack</p>
        <p class="abstract">*asmr voice* Let's all take a break. Unwind. And solve a nice friendly problem in elementary analysis. </p>
        <p class="abstract">Now that I've lulled you into a false sense of security, you should know that we'll be solving this (very concrete!) problem by using heavy duty machinery from category theory and logic. In particular, we'll be using the language of topos theory. In the process, we'll see why people care about constructive mathematics, how category theory can solve real problems, and whether topos theory really is as scary as its reputation makes it out to be. </p>
        <p class="abstract">We assume no background in topos theory, or indeed anything but basic category theory.</p>

        <h3>The infinite boundary</h3>
        <p class="author">Jacob Garcia</p>
        <p class="abstract">As far as topological spaces go, metric spaces are very nice. However, the notion of equivalence used in geometric group theory, quasi-isometry, is usually not a continuous function! In general, it is difficult to determine if two metric spaces are quasi-isometric. In this talk, I'll introduce a very powerful invariant for hyperbolic metric spaces called the visual boundary; not only does this boundary compactify the space, it is also a homeomorphism invariant for quasi-isometric spaces.</p>

        <h3>A Glimpse into the Understanding of Cell Polarity</h3>
        <p class="author">Alysha Toomey</p>
        <p class="abstract">One of the major tasks that a cell faces during its lifecycle is how to spatially localize its components. Cell polarity is fundamental for correct cell shape, as well as carrying out essential cellular functions, such as spatial coordination of cell division. Fission yeast are a model organism to study in the attempt to better understand cell polarity. We will discuss a couple models developed to explain how fission yeast properly regulate their shape and division cycle. If time allows, potential applications of these models will be discussed.</p>

        <h3>Divergence is only the Beginning</h3>
        <p class="author">Will Hoffer <a href="https://willhoffer.com">🌍</a></p>        
        <p class="abstract">When &#200;mile Borel brought his pioneering work on the resummation of divergent series to Mittag-Leffler, the established mathematican put his hand on the complete works of his teacher, Karl Weierstrauss, and told Borel sternly in Latin, ``The Master forbids it." In this talk, we will delve into the very same methods that made mathematicians of yore tremble.</p>
        <p class="abstract">Borel's work essentially amounts to formally applying a term-by-term inverse Laplace transform, which divides each coefficient by a factorial. As such, it turns divergent series whose coefficients grow at most factorially into possibly convergent ones. Under suitable conditions, this new function admits a Laplace tranform to undo the first Borel transform, and this function is asymptotically equivalent to the original divergent series.</p>
        <p class="abstract">Today, we shall explore Borel's work on resumming divergent series and see that this is only the beginning of a much larger field of active research known as resurgence.</p>

        <h3>Melting Snowflake Fractals</h3>
        <p class="author">Will Hoffer <a href="https://willhoffer.com">🌍</a></p>        
        <p class="abstract"> The von Koch snowflake is one of the first studied fractals and thus a great starting point for investigating fractal and spectral geometry. In this talk, we'll study how much heat flows into a fractal shape from its heated boundary. To that end, we'll discuss von Koch fractals, the heat equation, and how to find the total amount of heat which flows into the fractal. In particular, we build and solve an approximate functional equation in order to estimate the total amount of heat in the fractal after small amounts of time. </p>

        <h3>Colors, Strings, and Beads: Categories for Children</h3>
        <p class="author">Christian Williams</p>
        <p class="abstract">There is a graphical language for formal category theory [Myers 2016]. The language empowers users to understand concepts and theorems with striking facility and clarity. There is also a logical interpretation: colors are types, strings are judgements, and beads are inferences. Together, category theory and logic can be taught in a simple, colorful, and engaging way. To demonstrate, we explore how the concepts of adjunction and extensions (in the category of relations) might be taught as early as elementary school. </p>

        <h3>Boundaries at Infinity and Stable Subgroups</h3>
        <p class="author">Jacob Garcia</p>
        <p class="abstract">Given a proper, geodesic, Gromov-hyperbolic metric space X, one can construct a boundary on the space called the visual boundary. The topology of this visual boundary is an invariant under a natural equivalence for hyperbolic spaces, and has been extensively studied with respect to quasi-convex subgroups of Iso(X). There has been much recent work towards constructing an analogue to this boundary in non-hyperbolic spaces. </p>
        <p class="abstract">In this talk, I'll relive the trauma of my oral exam slides as we review some of the known properties of the visual boundary, some of the issues this boundary has with non-hyperbolic spaces, and we'll introduce a new analogue which can be used instead.</p>

        <h3>Intro to Random Walks: From an electrifying problem to modeling forest fires</h3>
        <p class="author">Neima Ghandian</p>
        <p class="abstract">This talk is a basic introduction into random walk theory, mainly focused on the Monte Carlo method for approximations and Markov Chains for exact solutions. Throughout the study of mathematics, physics has always been a huge source of problems and starting points of inquiry. However, as we generalize mathematics, we often leave the realm of “real world” application. BUT! There is a well-known connection between random walks and electric networks, and we will get to investigate some different techniques on arriving at a solution. Furthermore, if time permits, we explore a couple different ideas of how to apply the techniques from this talk, including the forest fire model mentioned in the title.</p>
