        <h3> Practice Defense </h3>
        <p class="author"> Matthew Overduin </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> In this talk I am going to present the basics and development of fractal geometry.  I am also going to present the explicit formula for fractal strings as well as the Taylor series expansion that represents it.  I am then going to discuss certain types of fractal strings (those that induce smooth functions) as well as the expansions that represent those.  I am going to discuss the Weierstrass fractal in more detail as well, and the fractional Taylor series that generates it. </p>

        <h3> Introducing Acute Myeloid Leukemia Modeling through ODE and PDE Models </h3>
        <p class="author"> Daley Thomale </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by their ability of self-renewal to replenish the stem cell pool and differentiate to more mature cells. The subsequent stages of progenitor cells also share some of this dual ability. It is yet unknown whether external signals modulate proliferation rate or rather the fraction of self-renewal. Three multicompartment models, which rely on a single external feedback mechanism, have been recently proposed. I compare these multi-compartment models with our updated multi-lineage ODE model. We adapt this multilineage model to have 2 versions of AML models, working towards understanding the progression and development of Acute Myeloid Leukemia cells. I will then expand from the ODE model and introduce a PDE advection diffusion reaction model for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. </p>

        <h3> Intro to Regularity Structures </h3>
        <p class="author"> Ryan Aschoff </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> Martin Hairer's theory of Regularity Structures is useful to solving semi linear stochastic partial differential equations of the form Lu = F(u,\xi) where \xi is some noise term (not necessarily Gaussian). There are a number of innovative ideas presented in the theory to overcome the classical ill-posedness of these types of previously inaccessible SPDE. The famous examples of its usage is in solving the KPZ equation and many euclidean field theories. During the talk, we will familiarize ourselves with some of the machinery involved. </p>

        <h3> Virtual Excessive Homology on Surface bundles </h3>
        <p class="author"> Jennifer Wang </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> In this talk we will talk about virtual excessive homology on surface bundles. Begin the talk by defining surface bundles, Mapping class group, monodromy representation and virtual excessive homology. Then introduce corresponding theorems from Dehn-Nielsen-baer, Eels-Earle- Schatz and Birman. Next I will introduce some relatively recent results of virtual excessive homology on 3-manifolds, specifically surface bundle over circle (Mapping torus) and mention briefly about how to generalize these results in the future. </p>

        <h3> A Very Brief Introduction to Quantum Computing </h3>
        <p class="author"> Satish Chandran </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> Quantum computing is a rapidly growing area that has found applications to many different fields such as cryptography and computational chemistry. In this talk, we will go over the basics of quantum mechanics and how to analyze quantum logic gates and circuits. We will also cover some famous quantum algorithms, namely the quantum Fourier transform, Shor's algorithm, and Grover's algorithm. </p>

        <h3> Why did the optimization problem cross the road? </h3>
        <p class="author"> James Alcala </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> To get to the other side, of course! But the other side of what? In this gentle talk, we'll talk about both sides of this metaphorical 'road', and why people who solve optimization problems - optimists, if you will - cross it pretty frequently. We'll start on the first side of the road with monotone inclusion problems and how they are formulated via monotone operators, one of the basic objects of the field. We'll cross the road and talk about fixed-point theorems in general, and how and why monotone inclusion problems are intimately connected to fixed point problems. We'll wrap it up with a real-life, practical example from my own research and see explicitly just how the famous Halpern iteration makes 'crossing the road' worth it for optimists in the present day. </p>

        <h3> In Search for the Driving force of Life </h3>
        <p class="author"> Neima Ghandian </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> In this talk we will try to describe the underlying driving forces in the growth of pollen tubes using a system of ODEs derived from Reaction Kinetics. This is a classic style of systems in Applied Math Biology, which can sometimes be significantly easier to approach using basic theory from Dynamical Systems. We will introduce the following concepts, the Law of Mass Action, Limit Cycles, and Phase Plane Analysis, to help us on our endeavor. Our discussion will be primarily constrained to the existence of limit cycles, as much of this problem is still open research. </p>

        <h3> Representation Theory of Finite Monoids </h3>
        <p class="author"> Raymond Matson <a href="https://raymondmatson.com/">üåç</a></p>        
        <p class="abstract"> While most mathematicians only encounter the representation theory of finite groups and, in the realm of research, delve into representations of Lie algebras, the representation theory of monoids is a less-discussed but richly developed area with nearly a century of theory behind it. In this talk, we'll navigate this lesser-explored terrain, exploring monoid representations through the lens of cell theory. Time permitting, we'll also touch upon their generalization to algebras and their categorification. </p>

While studying the endgame theory of Go, John Conway got inspired and develop the idea of the surreal numbers. In this talk I'll give you some of the intuition behind them and the more general concept of "game". Finally, we will look at some scenarios and be able to compute the result.</p>

        <h3> Constructing Span 2-Categories From Categories Without Pullbacks, And Examples "In The Wild" </h3>
        <p class="author"> Andrea Stine </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> Span categories are used to give an abstract compositional model for certain types of systems. The category of smooth manifolds, a starting point for a compositional model for classical mechanical systems, does not have all finite pullbacks. Prior work by Weisbart and Yassine identifies two necessary conditions for constructing span categories to circumvent this obstacle: F-pullbacks, and span tightness, but these conditions are insufficient to generalizing to higher categories. We introduce a new condition, tentatively named cospan tightness, to construct span 2-categories from categories without pullbacks, and investigate examples of F-pullbacks, span tightness, and cospan tightness. Warning: This talk's gonna just be category theory BS. I hope for it to be interesting category theory BS.

        <p class="author"> Gerardo Orozco-Fernandez </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> Finding a minimizer of a least gradient problem is often a difficult task. In the particular problem from my current research, with the proper assumptions, we may use Fenchel-Rockafellar to consider the dual problem and an Alternating Split Bregman Algorithm which converges to weak solutions of the dual problem and the original (primal) problem. In this talk, we will derive the algorithm and discuss its convergence. </p>

        <p class="abstract"> Developmental biologists study processes such as pattern formation, morphogenesis, and cellular signaling in an attempt to unravel the complexities of how organisms develop. Providing insights into the fundamental biology of life often requires joint work by both theoretical and experimental biologists. In this talk I will be discussing our contributions to understanding these processes in two different systems: pavement cells in plant leaves and the Drosophila (fruit fly) wing disc. </p>

        <p class="abstract"> In an increasingly interconnected world, efficient data transmission and network performance are paramount. In this introductory talk, we will unravel the complexities and common challenges of queuing theory‚Äîa powerful tool for comprehending and optimizing network performance. Queuing theory plays a vital role in data traffic management, delay reduction, and overall network efficiency enhancement. We will explore standard examples like Deficit Round Robin (DRR) and Start-Time Fair Queuing (STFQ) as classic algorithms that serve as our stepping stones into the world of network queues. If time permits, I'll also share insights and applications from my summer internship.
