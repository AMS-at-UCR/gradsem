        <h3> Submersions and Intermediate Ricci Curvature </h3>
        <p class="author"> Hasan El-Hasan </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> In this talk, we will first introduce the notion of intermediate Ricci curvature of a Riemannian manifold, and what it means for that quantity to be "positive." Then we will discuss the main result, which is that Riemannian submersions need not preserve this positivity. Fred Wilhelm and a collaborator have already proved the analogous statement for positive Ricci curvature, and we seek to extend their result into the intermediate setting.

        <p class="author"> Luis Palacios </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> The notion of curvature appears firstly for curves. We will explore an interesting object called the evolute of a curve and will show some properties. Then after we are comfortable with that, we'll go to the concept of curvature in surfaces and what does it mean with physical objects in 3d space. Finally, I'm going to show how we can use curvature to create clothes and crochet.

        <h3> Multiscale modeling of CAR T-cell treatment for heterogeneous glioma </h3>
        <p class="author"> RunPeng (Tony) Li </p>  
        <p class="abstract"> Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell based immunotherapy has been considered one of the most successful adoptive cell-based immunotherapy in cancer treatment and has been FDA-approved since 2017. While CAR T-cell therapy has shown its efficacy in leukemia, for solid tumors, the treatment still has a few challenges including (1) trafficking CAR T-cells into solid tumors, (2) a hostile tumor microenvironment that suppresses T-cell activity, and (3) tumor antigen heterogeneity. In my presentation, we mainly investigated the antigen heterogeneity of high-grade glioma and explored the response spatially by agent-based model and PDE model. We used the data provided by the City of Hope to simulate our model through PhysiCell and were able to guide the treatment schedule, location of injection, dosages, and frequencies.

        <h3> Symplectic Hodge Theory </h3>
        <p class="author"> Shane Rankin </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> Symplectic Hodge Theory was introduced in the late 1980s to provide tools to understand when symplectic structures on smooth manifolds could be made into fully Kähler structures. Much work has gone into generalizing the theory since then to more geometric settings. In this talk we’ll discuss recent work extending this to Lie Algebroids, and the necessary algebraic framework to make such an extension possible. This is in preparation for my Oral Qualifying exam, questions are encouraged!!

        <h3> Compositionality of Open Kinematic Systems Involving Constraints and Feedback </h3>
        <p class="author"> Andrea Stine </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> Existing results regarding composition of open systems in classical mechanics are limited by the sequential nature of span composition to composition along simple open chains, and do not specify configuration spaces of interactions. A category of rigid inclusions of cospan diagrams allows for direct interactions between actors to be introduced into an open system one-at-a-time, where basins of cospans form constraint spaces for interactions. When a category has F-pullbacks for a cone-tight functor F, limits of certain cospan diagrams where constraints may be constructed and are unique up to isomorphism. We use these results to specify the kinematics of interactions that impose geometric constraints between actors and compose kinematic chains involving feedback. This talk is in preparation for my oral qualifying exam, so I appreciate you asking questions! Simultaneously, it will be a board talk, so apologies if I struggle to deliver it succinctly.

        <h3> Practice defense </h3>
        <p class="author"> Matthew Overduin </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> In this talk I am going to present the basics and development of fractal geometry.  I will introduce the definitions of both ordinary fractal strings and generalized fractal strings. I am also going to present the explicit formula for generalized fractal strings as well as the Taylor series expansion that represents it.  We can recover a fractal via the explicit formula if we know its complex dimensions and given that our string is languid.  In order to represent the explicit formula as a fractional Taylor series, I used the Schwartz definition of fractional derivative of distributions.  I will present an example of a fractal, called the Cantor fractal, for which we can extract the fractal for its known complex dimensions via the explicit formula since the Cantor fractal is languid.  In the next part of the talk, I am going to present a new topic called fractal cohomology.  This is particularly important for realizing the Weierstrass curve as a two-dimensional fractal.  I am going to introduce the iterative function system that generates this curve as well as the fractal power series that represents it.  The fractal power series has its roots in fractal cohomology and is generated through the iterated function system.  I will present on this as well.

        <h3>  Surfaces in R^3 with Prescribed Extrinsic and Intrinsic Curvatures </h3>
        <p class="author"> Bill Terry </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> The question of whether a manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space is a long-standing problem in differential geometry. In this talk, we will look at some background and context on isometric embeddings, and then we will study isometrically embedded surfaces of revolution with different prescribed extrinsic/intrinsic curvatures. In particular, we prescribe the induced metric, the mean curvature with conformal metric, the second fundamental form, and the conjugate momentum, in order to study the resulting nonlinear ODE's.

        <h3> Higher Teichmuller Theory </h3>
        <p class="author"> Zachary Virgilio </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> Teichmuller theory began as the classification of complex structures on a Riemann surface.  The space of all such structures is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{6g-6}$ and it became known as Teichmuller space.  From another point of view, it is the moduli space of all surface group representations that are discrete and faithful into the Lie group $PSL(2, \mathbb{R})$.  Higher Teichmuller theory searches for generalizations into higher rank Lie groups and one of its aims is to identify connected components of the moduli space consisting solely of such ‘nice’ representations.  Many tools are used in this study, and this talk will highlight the role played by the theory of Higgs bundles in higher Teichmuller theory.

        <h3> Dissipative Solutions to the Surface Quasigeostrophic Equations </h3>
        <p class="author"> Ryan Aschoff </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> In a friendly expository manner, we'll elaborate on some basic techniques useful for solving PDEs. The Surface Quasigeostrophic equation (SQG) occurs naturally as a model for surface ocean currents and mathematically constitutes the 2D equivalent of the Navier Stokes Equations, featuring many of the same types of singularities. In this talk, we'll discuss ideas from harmonic and fourier analysis that will be useful to prove the well-posedness and smoothness of solutions to the equation with initial data valued in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^2).  These results follow from my most recent research in trying to prove the well-posedness of SQG with initial data valued in uniformly local L^p spaces.

        <h3> Surgery on Manifolds and Scalar Curvature </h3>
        <p class="author"> Mohammad Vaezi </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> The space of all Riemannian metrics on a given manifold is an infinite dimensional Frechet manifold. This enormous space is, in fact, convex and so not topologically interesting. But things might become much more complicated when we put a geometric condition on our metric. As an example, the space of positive scalar curvature metrics on the 7-sphere has infinitely many distinct path-components. The main tool for studying the topology of the space of positive scalar curvature metrics is the surgery theorem. This theorem was proved by Gromov and Lawson and, independently, by Schoen and Yau. In this talk, we will have a look at surgery on manifolds and we will see that the surgery theorem and prime decomposition theorem give a classification of positive scalar curvature 3-manifolds .  </p>

        <p class="abstract"> This talk will go through some basic definitions of extensions, group actions, and cohomology.  We will eventually classify abelian extensions by their second cohomology. This is something I recently read through for my research, since the proof is not complicated, I will try to make this talk more approachable for people that are new to the topic. Hopefully this process helps me to organize my learning results and helps others to learn a bit more about these topics.  </p>

        <p class="author"> Chris Wolird </p>
        <p class="abstract"> The overlooked younger sibling of Look-and-say sequences, think-and-say sequences are "digitally descriptive iterations" of numbers (and numberish things) which usually result in self-describing numbers like 21322314 (which has two 1's, three 2's, two 3's, and one 4). We cover silly results and open problems from the past 30 years like: the limited loop length lemma, transfinite trimming tricks, multiset multiplicity maps, pre-period predictions, growth spurt exceptions, and pea-pattern prime pickings. </p>

        <p class="author"> Zachary Virgilio </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> The underlying idea behind homology is that you can count the 'holes' in a space.  There is an interesting connection between the first homology group of a surface and the fundamental group.  From this relation, it is possible to classify G-covering spaces of a surface using the first cohomology group with coefficients in G.  In this talk we will outline the ideas behind this connection and spend some time working through examples. </p>

        <p class="abstract"> In preparation for the speaker's oral exam, we'll have a look at Besov spaces, various embeddings, stochastic integration on Besov spaces and a formulation of the stochastic heat equation in the rough path setting. Inspired by very recent work by Peter Friz, Benjamin Seeger, and Pavel Zorin Kranich, this work spans many topics in analysis and PDE theory. This line of research is novel for (among other reasons) its application of Besov-valued rough differential equations to SPDE theory and the reframing of stochastic integration in terms of the language of increments </p>

        <p class="abstract"> While most mathematicians only encounter the representation theory of finite groups and, in the realm of research, delve into representations of Lie algebras, the representation theory of monoids is a less-discussed but richly developed area with nearly a century of theory behind it. In this talk, we'll navigate this lesser-explored terrain, exploring monoid representations through the lens of cell theory. Time permitting, we'll also touch upon their generalization to algebras and their categorification. </p>

        <h3> Constructing Span 2-Categories From Categories Without Pullbacks, And Examples "In The Wild" </h3>
        <p class="author"> Andrea Stine </p>        
        <p class="abstract"> Span categories are used to give an abstract compositional model for certain types of systems. The category of smooth manifolds, a starting point for a compositional model for classical mechanical systems, does not have all finite pullbacks. Prior work by Weisbart and Yassine identifies two necessary conditions for constructing span categories to circumvent this obstacle: F-pullbacks, and span tightness, but these conditions are insufficient to generalizing to higher categories. We introduce a new condition, tentatively named cospan tightness, to construct span 2-categories from categories without pullbacks, and investigate examples of F-pullbacks, span tightness, and cospan tightness. Warning: This talk's gonna just be category theory BS. I hope for it to be interesting category theory BS.

I hope to give you all the same sense of interactivity by presenting a talk that branches! At the start of the seminar, I'll ask for a vote in order to decide between four possible topics: 1. applications of topos theory, 2. an introduction to condensed mathematics, 3. what are infinity categories, and why should you care?, and 4. topological quantum field theories and you. Depending on the topic, there may be other points in the talk where we will have further votes for further branches, for instance in the topos theory talk we could give applications to either algebra, analysis, or logic. I can't wait to see you there!
