        <h3>On Investigating chemical signaling networks¬†in the Drosophila wing disc</h3>
        <p class="author">Alysha Toomey</p>        
        <p class="abstract"> During development of the Drosophila (fruit fly) wing disc, the regulation of cell height and tissue curvature is crucial in developing correct tissue shapes. This requires the interplay between mechanical forces and chemical signaling pathways, at both the cell and tissue levels. Although there are many known components in this process, there is still much work to be done. In this talk we will walk through the new signaling regulations identified through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, as well as the process of using these models to investigate the robustness of the proposed networks. </p>

        <h3>On Asymptotic Expansions with Complex Exponents and their Applications</h3>
        <p class="author">Will Hoffer <a href="https://willhoffer.com">üåç</a></p>        
        <p class="abstract">What do fractals and prime powers have in common? Complex exponents! Specifically, functions which describe these objects (the size of an epsilon neighborhood of a fractal and the summatory von Mangoldt function, as respective examples) admit asymptotic expansions which look like power series, but with complex numbers as exponents.</p>
        <p class="abstract">In this talk, we discuss formalization of such complex exponent power series/asymptotic expansions in order to more systematically study them and extend existing analytic machinery. In particular, we extend the Borel transform to classes of such expansions suitable for these applications and discuss Borel summation of such complex-powered asymptotics expansions.</p>

        <h3> Logic in Color </h3>
        <p class="author"> Christian Williams </p>
        <p class="abstract"> Category theory can be understood as a vast generalization of what we mean by "logic". I will present this language of "generalized logic", also known as the "coend calculus". Together with a complementary visual language of colors, strings, and beads, I propose that anyone can learn category theory on a much deeper level than current material/books. I'll demonstrate by presenting the concept of limit. </p>

        <h4>28 October 2022</h4>
        <h3> An Introduction to the Nonabelian Hodge Correspondence </h3>
        <p class="author"> Zachary Virgilio </p>
        <p class="abstract"> The Narasimhan-Seshadri Theorem establishes a correspondence between stable vector bundles and unitary representations of the fundamental group of a compact Riemann surface.  The Nonabelian Hodge Correspondence expands this to homeomorphisms between the moduli spaces of representations, flat connections on the bundle whose monodromy comes from the representation, and Higgs bundles for a K√§hler manifold.  In this talk we shall restrict to the case of Riemann surfaces where general conditions on the Higgs field are trivially satisfied, making the correspondence easier to understand.  We will give an overview of the correspondence including the Corlette-Donaldson theorem and then shall look at some properties of the Dolbeault Moduli space. </p>

        <h3> Projective Points Over Matrices and Their Separability Properties </h3>
        <p class="author"> Bill Terry </p>
        <p class="abstract"> We will consider topological quotients of real and complex matrices by various subgroups and their connections to spacetime structures. These spaces are naturally interpreted as projective points. In particular, we will look at quotients of nonzero 2 x 2 matrices by the subgroups GL, SL, O, and SO and study various results about their topological separability properties. We will discuss the interesting result that, as the group we quotient by gets smaller, the separability properties of the quotient improve. </p>

        <h4>07 October 2022</h4>
        <h3> A Rigidity Condition for Composition in an Augmented Span Double Category </h3>
        <p class="author"> Andrea Stine </p>
        <p class="abstract"> Augmented generalized span categories provide a compositional framework for mathematical models of simple open systems in classical mechanics. The idea of augmenting an object with an element of a vector space extends the earlier idea of an augmentation to a framework that includes Riemannian metrics and symplectic 2-forms.  The procedure for constructing augmentations on composite spans was previously ad-hoc, but a rigidity condition in the extended setting forces a unique compositional rule for augmentations on pullbacks. The procedure involves defining appropriate functors to $k$-\textbf{Vect} and constructing action categories from these functors. The framework we explore should allow the compositional principle to be applied more broadly and with more intrinsic rigidity. </p>

        <h4>30 September 2022</h4>
        <h3> Stated Skein Modules and DAHAs </h3>
        <p class="author"> Raymond Matson <a href="https://raymondmatson.com/">üåç</a></p>
        <p class="abstract"> Many knot invariants come from looking at highly noncommutative associated groups. As these groups can be incredibly difficult to work with, one can instead consider corresponding commutative algebras and representations. However, if you want to still extract knot invariants you need to quantize these algebras and skein theory provides a breathable way to understand these deformations. In 2012, Berest and Samuelson provided a geometric way to understand these invariants and in the process uncovered certain defining modules for a bigger underlying beast, double affine Hecke algebras. I will discuss these module structures and how they act in the context of a newer, more general skein theory recently established by Thang L√™. This new theory, called stated skein theory, provides significant additional algebraic structure to these algebras and modules and will hopefully lead to more insights into a nicer presentation of these DAHAs. </p>
