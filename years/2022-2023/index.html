        <h3> Projective Points Over Matrices and Their Separability Properties </h3>
        <p class="author"> Bill Terry </p>
        <p class="abstract"> We will consider topological quotients of real and complex matrices by various subgroups and their connections to spacetime structures. These spaces are naturally interpreted as projective points. In particular, we will look at quotients of nonzero 2 x 2 matrices by the subgroups GL, SL, O, and SO and study various results about their topological separability properties. We will discuss the interesting result that, as the group we quotient by gets smaller, the separability properties of the quotient improve. </p>

        <h3>On Asymptotic Expansions with Complex Exponents and their Applications</h3>
        <p class="author">Will Hoffer <a href="https://willhoffer.com">üåç</a></p>        
        <p class="abstract">What do fractals and prime powers have in common? Complex exponents! Specifically, functions which describe these objects (the size of an epsilon neighborhood of a fractal and the summatory von Mangoldt function, as respective examples) admit asymptotic expansions which look like power series, but with complex numbers as exponents.</p>
        <p class="abstract">In this talk, we discuss formalization of such complex exponent power series/asymptotic expansions in order to more systematically study them and extend existing analytic machinery. In particular, we extend the Borel transform to classes of such expansions suitable for these applications and discuss Borel summation of such complex-powered asymptotics expansions.</p>

        <h3> A Rigidity Condition for Composition in an Augmented Span Double Category </h3>
        <p class="author"> Andrea Stine </p>
        <p class="abstract"> Augmented generalized span categories provide a compositional framework for mathematical models of simple open systems in classical mechanics. The idea of augmenting an object with an element of a vector space extends the earlier idea of an augmentation to a framework that includes Riemannian metrics and symplectic 2-forms.  The procedure for constructing augmentations on composite spans was previously ad-hoc, but a rigidity condition in the extended setting forces a unique compositional rule for augmentations on pullbacks. The procedure involves defining appropriate functors to $k$-\textbf{Vect} and constructing action categories from these functors. The framework we explore should allow the compositional principle to be applied more broadly and with more intrinsic rigidity. </p>

        <h3> Stated Skein Modules and DAHAs </h3>
        <p class="author"> Raymond Matson <a href="https://raymondmatson.com/">üåç</a></p>
        <p class="abstract"> Many knot invariants come from looking at highly noncommutative associated groups. As these groups can be incredibly difficult to work with, one can instead consider corresponding commutative algebras and representations. However, if you want to still extract knot invariants you need to quantize these algebras and skein theory provides a breathable way to understand these deformations. In 2012, Berest and Samuelson provided a geometric way to understand these invariants and in the process uncovered certain defining modules for a bigger underlying beast, double affine Hecke algebras. I will discuss these module structures and how they act in the context of a newer, more general skein theory recently established by Thang L√™. This new theory, called stated skein theory, provides significant additional algebraic structure to these algebras and modules and will hopefully lead to more insights into a nicer presentation of these DAHAs. </p>
